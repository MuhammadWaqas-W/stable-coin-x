# Design of the Stable Coin (X)

- Relative Stability : pegged to USD

  -  chainlink price feeds to be used to extract the data feeds
  -  set a func to exchange ETH and BTC with equivalent USD or X

- Stability mechanism (minting) : Algorithmic(dece) instead of Collateralized (which is centralized)
  -  ppl can only mint hte stabel coin X with enough collateral
- Collateral (will be exogennous )

  -  wETH
  -  wBTC

> the wrapped version (ERC20 versions) of ETH and BTC

> exogneous vars are vars that are not affected by the choide func in an econ system
